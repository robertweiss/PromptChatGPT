# PromptChatGPT – A Processwire module to process a field value with the Chat GPT API

> [!WARNING]  
> **Deprecation Notice (26 June 2025):** This module is now deprecated. Please use the new [PromptAI](https://github.com/robertweiss/PromptAI) module for enhanced functionality and improved AI integration.

PromptChatGPT is a module for the CMS Processwire which is triggered on save and processes the value of a page field using ChatGPT. The processed value can be saved back to the field or to another field on the same page.

### Installation
1. Download and install [PromptChatGPT](https://github.com/robertweiss/PromptChatGPT)
2. Configure the module settings if needed (ChatGPT Key is required, [you can get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
3. Open a page, click on the arrow next to the save-button, choose ›Save + send to ChatGPT‹

> **Note**
> You need to add a billing method in order to obtain a valid ChatGPT API key, and the key must be generated AFTER you have provided your billing credentials. Otherwise, the key won’t work (tested and validated in March 2023)

### Settings
- ChatGPT API Key (required)
- Included Templates (Templates which will show the dropdown option. If no selection is made, all templates are included)
- Source Field (Field which will be processed)
- Target Field (Field which is used to save the response)
- Commando string for ChatGPT (Will be prefixed to the source field so you can add hints what to do with the text, e.g. ›write a summary with max. 400 characters of the following text:‹)
- Test Settings (send a test request to ChatGPT on module config save)

### Field support
- PageTitle(Language)
- Text(Language)
- Textarea(Language)

**Please note, this is an alpha release.** Please use in production only after thorough testing for your own project and create Github issues for bugs found if possible.
